# Satellite-Segmentation

This is a satellite remote sensing segmentation project wirtten by Keras based on SegNet and U-Net.

## main ideas
1. segmented by SegNet
2. segmented by U-Net
3. model emsamble: SegNet + U-Net

## other ideas
1. GAN pix2pix: generate some fake satellite images to enlarge the dataset
2. DeepLab
3. Mask RCNN
4. FCN
5. RefineNet
6. post=processing: CRF
